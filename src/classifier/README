Classifier class uses the following

  1. ClassifierConfig
  2. CorpusManager
  3. NaiveBayesClassifier

A specialized Class is expected to inherit the Classifier class by providing the following functions:

  1. GetCorpus

The following are some of the functions which are agnostic to the super class and are hence written in NaiveBayesClassifier.

  1. MakeDictionary - some naive bayes code is rewritten within gist_maker. this MakeDictionary function converts the corpus files into a map to be used by gist_maker.
  2. GenerateProbabilities - this converts raw frequency counts into Naive Bayes Probabilities.
  3. MakePriorProbabilitiesFile - prior probabilites used in NBC. this can be ignored while training.
