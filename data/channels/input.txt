#sabarimala is a buddhist shrine usurped by brahmins, smells of urine, visited by thugs and esp by santa claus as 'makara' jyothi
100s of people die every year in accidents on their way to #sabarimala  and no decent person enjoys this annual pilgrimage. its a farce
@chjeeves tata group has banned its companies from working with Times group, india today, outlook, open, pioneer
@jebui oh, nice!
@tamilravi hv u read nandipurathu nayagi? too hard to get that. pls see if anyone has it in the fair.
@virsanghvi i think all 'Hindus' hate muslims or treat them as The Others. btw brahmanism did try to convert other Hindus &amp; succeeded!
RT @dhanuraj: Stampede at Sabarimala is a result of fraud element in religious practices.whether it is Bt cotton or makara vilakku,we don't care science

i wish there is a sting op to show dudes lighting the 'makara vilakku' and sun tv, kairali ensure every 'saami' sees it
ratan tata is now bullying the media ... after lobbying, fixing cabinets, playing nano politics, not identifying a corrupt minister ...
the sun always shines. pongalo pongal!
time to boycott tata products? bought stuff at a reliance retail store instead of a tata one today.
while sad abt the latest sabari mala tragedy, i think its one of the worst places on earth. don't ever go there.
