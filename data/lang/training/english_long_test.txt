GULL MODELS

Use: Deterring gulls from loafing near the model.
Description: Models must be a faithful replica of the species to be deterred and they should give the appearance of a gull that has died and fallen to the ground.
Application: Determination of where the models should be placed must be made on a case-by-case basis. Observations must be made of where the gulls are loafing and whether they display a preference for one location over another. Models should be placed in areas where gulls rest and cause a particular hazard. However, gulls may not be entirely deterred from using the airport and, in some circumstances, moving the gulls to a new loafing area may increase the hazard rather than lessen it. The potential for increasing the hazard should be considered before models are placed on the airfield.
Gulls may occasionally move into the area where the models are deployed. Gulls that do this must be dispersed by other means. 
Advantages: The active dispersal of gulls from the area where the models are deployed should be reduced.
Disadvantages: Because the effectiveness of the models depends on them looking as much as possible like the species to be deterred, they must be custom made. In many cases, models will change the preferred loafing area of gulls, but models will not deter gulls entirely from using the airport. Thus, additional control measures will be necessary.
Effectiveness: Experiments on airports in various parts of the world have shown that models of gulls or dead gulls can deter other gulls from loafing nearby for periods ranging from eight days to eight months. Effectiveness seems to vary with the species of gull that is involved and with the geographic location, but part of the variation may be due to use of models that did not resemble the real gull closely enough or the use of dead gulls that were too badly weathered. Gulls appear to respond consistently only to recently killed gulls or to models giving the appearance of a recently killed gull. Preserved gulls rapidly lose their effectiveness.
Effectiveness may also be affected by the availability of other loafing areas. If no other areas are available, models may not be successful.
One of the few quantitative studies of model effectiveness showed that 21 models deployed over an area of 13.3 hectares reduced the aggregations of loafing gulls by 80 per cent. Models were left in one place, and they maintained their effectiveness for the entire study period of eight months. These models were exact likenesses of the gulls they were intended to deter. In this study, it was found that gulls responded selectively to models not only on the basis of species but also of year class. That is, a model of an adult most effectively deterred adults, whereas a model of a two-year-old gull most effectively deterred two year olds.
Permits Required: A permit from the Canadian Wildlife Service is required for scaring gulls.
