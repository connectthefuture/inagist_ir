Project Name: ERL_NIF

1. This folder contains erlang, c and cpp code pieces to make your erlang modules talk to ir_cpp libraries.

2. ir_cpp libraries are all written in cpp. c is merely used as an intermediary to make erlang talk to cpp.

3. Makefile provided in this folder can be used to produce shared libraries and used as nifs in your erlang code.

4. 'make clean; make all' will produce all the libraries, but will take some time to compile.

5. 'make clean; make gist' for example will produce libgist_collector.so library file in the specified directory. (default export lib directory is ../../lib/. you can change this by modifying ../Makefile.incl)
